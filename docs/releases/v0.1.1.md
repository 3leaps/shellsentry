# Release Notes

Note: Keep only the latest three releases here, in newest-to-oldest order.

## v0.1.1

### Highlights

- Self-verification and self-update capabilities with cryptographic verification.
- Embedded minisign public key as build-time trust anchor.
- Follows sfetch patterns for secure update workflow.

### Added

- `--self-verify` flag displays verification instructions and embedded trust anchors.
- `--self-update` flag performs cryptographically verified updates from GitHub releases.
- `--self-update-force` allows major version jumps and dev build updates.
- `--self-update-dir` specifies custom install directory.
- `--json` flag for machine-readable `--self-verify` output.
- SHA2-512SUMS support with automatic fallback to SHA256SUMS.

### Security

- Minisign signature verification is mandatory before trusting any checksum.
- Atomic binary replacement with rollback on failure.
- Dev builds blocked from self-update unless `--self-update-force` is used.
- Major version jumps require explicit `--self-update-force` confirmation.

### Stream Output

- Text output from `--self-verify` goes to stderr (diagnostic).
- JSON output from `--self-verify --json` goes to stdout (machine-parseable).
- All self-update progress messages go to stderr.
